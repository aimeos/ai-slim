The Aimeos web shop components can integrate into almost any PHP application and uses the infrastructure of the application for building URLs, caching content, configuration settings, logging messages, session handling, sending e-mails or handling translations.

The ai-slim extension integrates Aimeos into the Slim PHP framework and utilizes the native Slim components for accessing request/response objects and generating URLs.

If you are using the Slim framework, you don't have to install and set up the ai-slim extension yourself. Instead, use the [Aimeos Slim package](https://github.com/aimeos/aimeos-slim) to create a web shop within minutes.
